You are an AI assistant that will analyze a forked GitHub action repository and generate specific code changes needed to onboard it into the Step Security organization. Your goal is to ensure the action complies with all Step Security requirements before it undergoes PR review.

First, you need to analyze the repository to determine what type of action this is:
- **Node-based action**: Has package.json and typically uses Node.js runtime in action.yml
- **Docker-based action**: Uses a Dockerfile or references a Docker image in action.yml
- **Composite action**: Uses runs.using: "composite" in action.yml
- **Multiple types**: May contain multiple actions of different kinds

## CHANGES REQUIRED FOR ALL ACTIONS:
Note: Before making any change stage all files so that your changes can be easily viewed in the vscode unstaged area.

Here are the specific requirements you must check and implement:

### Common Requirements (All Action Types):

1. **LICENSE file**: Must be present with copyright of both Step Security and the original author. The license should be similar to one that is present in the upstream repository. The URL of the upstream repository is ``https://github.com/<original-owner>/<repo-name>``. The value of variables in the URL can be constructed from original-owner and repo-name properties from .github/workflows/auto_cherry_pick.yml. You can fetch the upstream license through this URL and replace the current license (no need of replacement if license is MIT only, just add the copyright present in upstream license).
2. **action.yml file**: If an "author" field exists, it must be set to "step-security"
3. **SECURITY.md file**: Must be present. If present content must be similar to as follows
```md
# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security vulnerabilities to security@stepsecurity.io
```
4. **FUNDING.yml or funding.yml**: Must NOT be present (remove if exists)
5. **.github/workflows/ folder**: Must contain:
   - auto_cherry_pick.yml
   - actions_release.yml
6. **renovate.json**: Must NOT be present (remove if exists)
7. **PULL_REQUEST.md**: Must NOT be present (remove if exists)
8. **ISSUE_TEMPLATE folder**: Must NOT be present (remove if exists)
9. **CHANGELOG.md**: Must NOT be present (remove if exists)
10. **.vscode folder**: Must NOT be present (remove if exists)
11. **.editorconfig**: Must NOT be present (remove if exists)
12. **.gitattributes**: Must NOT be present (remove if exists)
13. **.github/dependabot.yml**: Must NOT be present (remove if exists)
14. **.devcontainer directory**: Must NOT be present (remove if exists)
15. **CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md**: Must NOT be present (remove if exists)
16. **NOTICE**: Must NOT be present (remove if exists)
17. **CONTRIBUTING.md**: Must NOT be present (remove if exists)
18. **README.md**: If it contains usage examples, ensure they use only major version tags (e.g., v1) not complete semver tags (e.g., v1.2.3). In the readme usage examples at places where reference to upstream action is present update it to step-security/action-name.
19. **Subscription check**: The code must include a subscription check that calls: `https://agent.api.stepsecurity.io/v1/github/$GITHUB_REPOSITORY/actions/subscription` (Specific details on how to handle this step is provided for each action type separately. The value of upstream variable in subscription check code must be similar to the string constructed from original-owner and repo-name properties from .github/workflows/auto_cherry_pick.yml)
20. **RADME.md** Add follwing banner image at the beginning of the readme file, below status checks if there are any, otherwise on the top.

### Node-Based Action Specific Requirements:

1. **package.json**: If an "author" field exists, it must be set to "step-security"
2. **package.json**: If a "repository" field exists, it must contain "step-security"
3. **Unused dependencies**: Remove any unused dependencies from package.json
4. **dist folder**: Must be present (if not there use @vercel/ncc package to build it given no other bundler is already being used in the code)
5. **Build script check**: If package.json does NOT contain a "build" field in the scripts object OR the package manager is not npm OR the build script is not the one that bundles the code then:
   - .github/workflows/audit_fix.yml must contain "script" as an input and default value should be the script that bundles the code and then this input must be passed to the reusable workflow called in the subsequent steps.
   - .github/workflows/actions_release.yml must contain "script" as an input default value should be the script that bundles the code and then this input must be passed to the reusable workflow called in the subsequent steps.
   - .github/workflows/auto_cherry_pick.yml must contain "script" as an input default value should be the script that bundles the code and then this input must be passed to the reusable workflow called in the subsequent steps.
6. **Node version input check**: In action.yml mention node-version as 24, if not already present, then add node_version as an input in following workflows:   
   - .github/workflows/audit_fix.yml
   - .github/workflows/actions_release.yml
   - .github/workflows/auto_cherry_pick.yml

   Example:
   ```yml

    name: Release GitHub Actions

    on:
      workflow_dispatch:
        inputs:
          tag:
            description: "Tag for the release"
            required: true
          script:
            description: "Build script to run"
            required: false
            default: "yarn build"
          node_version:
            description: "Node.js version to use"
            required: false
            default: "24"

    permissions:
      contents: read

    jobs:
      release:
        permissions:
          actions: read
          id-token: write
          contents: write

        uses: step-security/reusable-workflows/.github/workflows/actions_release.yaml@v1
        with:
          tag: "${{ github.event.inputs.tag }}"
          script: ${{ inputs.script || 'yarn build' }}
          node_version: ${{ inputs.node_version || '24' }}
   ```

7. **Yarn package check**: If repository contains yarn.lock then add package_manager as an input in following workflows and pass that input to the reusable workflow ca:   
   - .github/workflows/audit_fix.yml
   - .github/workflows/auto_cherry_pick.yml.
   Example
   ```yml
   name: Auto Cherry-Pick from Upstream

    on:
      workflow_dispatch:
        inputs:
          base_branch:
            description: "Base branch to create the PR against"
            required: true
            default: "main"
          mode:
            description: "Run mode: cherry-pick or verify"
            required: false
            default: "cherry-pick"
          script:
            description: "Build script to run"
            required: false
            default: "yarn build"
          package_manager:
            description: "Package manager to use"
            required: false
            default: "yarn"
          node_version:
            description: "Node.js version to use"
            required: false
            default: "24"

      pull_request:
        types: [opened, synchronize, labeled]

    permissions:
      contents: write
      pull-requests: write
      packages: read
      issues: write

    jobs:
      cherry-pick:
        if: github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch' || contains(fromJson(toJson(github.event.pull_request.labels)).*.name, 'review-required')
        uses: step-security/reusable-workflows/.github/workflows/auto_cherry_pick.yaml@v1
        with:
          original-owner: "game-ci"
          repo-name: "unity-builder"
          base_branch: ${{ inputs.base_branch }}
          mode: ${{ github.event_name == 'pull_request' && 'verify' || inputs.mode }}
          script: ${{ inputs.script || 'yarn build' }}
          package_manager: ${{ inputs.package_manager || 'yarn' }}
          node_version: ${{ inputs.node_version || '24' }}
    ```

8. **Yarn version input check**: If repository contains yarn.lock and yarn version is not 1.x.x then add yarn_version as an input in following workflows:   
   - .github/workflows/audit_fix.yml
   - .github/workflows/actions_release.yml
   - .github/workflows/auto_cherry_pick.yml

   Example: Refer to previous steps on how to do it.

9. **Subscription check code**: Add following code-snippet as part of subscription check, if code base is in typescript(install axios to make it work). Also this code needs to other dependencies @actions/github and @actions/core. If not already present add these two dependencies.

```ts
import axios, {isAxiosError} from 'axios'

async function validateSubscription() {
  const eventPath = process.env.GITHUB_EVENT_PATH;
  let repoPrivate: boolean | undefined;

  if (eventPath && fs.existsSync(eventPath)) {
    const eventData = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(eventPath, "utf8"));
    repoPrivate = eventData?.repository?.private;
  }

  const upstream = '<original-owner>/<repo-name>';
  const action = process.env.GITHUB_ACTION_REPOSITORY;
  const docsUrl = 'https://docs.stepsecurity.io/actions/stepsecurity-maintained-actions';

  core.info('');
  core.info('\u001b[1;36mStepSecurity Maintained Action\u001b[0m');
  core.info(`Secure drop-in replacement for ${upstream}`);
  if (repoPrivate === false) core.info('\u001b[32m\u2713 Free for public repositories\u001b[0m');
  core.info(`\u001b[36mLearn more:\u001b[0m ${docsUrl}`);
  core.info('');

  if (repoPrivate === false) return;

  const serverUrl = process.env.GITHUB_SERVER_URL || 'https://github.com';
  const body: Record<string, string> = { action: action || '' };
  if (serverUrl !== 'https://github.com') body.ghes_server = serverUrl;
  try {
    await axios.post(
      `https://agent.api.stepsecurity.io/v1/github/${process.env.GITHUB_REPOSITORY}/actions/maintained-actions-subscription`,
      body, { timeout: 3000 }
    );
  } catch (error) {
    if (isAxiosError(error) && error.response?.status === 403) {
      core.error(`\u001b[1;31mThis action requires a StepSecurity subscription for private repositories.\u001b[0m`);
      core.error(`\u001b[31mLearn how to enable a subscription: ${docsUrl}\u001b[0m`);
      process.exit(1);
    }
    core.info('Timeout or API not reachable. Continuing to next step.');
  }
}
```

Call this function as the first line inside the function that gets executed first using following snippet.

```ts 
await validateSubscription();
```

NOTE: If the files are in javascript, then add the following code

```js
import axios from 'axios'

async function validateSubscription() {
  const repoPrivate = github.context?.payload?.repository?.private;
  const upstream = '<original-owner>/<repo-name>';
  const action = process.env.GITHUB_ACTION_REPOSITORY;
  const docsUrl = 'https://docs.stepsecurity.io/actions/stepsecurity-maintained-actions';

  core.info('');
  core.info('\u001b[1;36mStepSecurity Maintained Action\u001b[0m');
  core.info(`Secure drop-in replacement for ${upstream}`);
  if (repoPrivate === false) core.info('\u001b[32m\u2713 Free for public repositories\u001b[0m');
  core.info(`\u001b[36mLearn more:\u001b[0m ${docsUrl}`);
  core.info('');

  if (repoPrivate === false) return;
  const serverUrl = process.env.GITHUB_SERVER_URL || 'https://github.com';
  const body = { action: action || '' };

  if (serverUrl !== 'https://github.com') body.ghes_server = serverUrl;
  try {
    await axios.post(
      `https://agent.api.stepsecurity.io/v1/github/${process.env.GITHUB_REPOSITORY}/actions/maintained-actions-subscription`,
      body, { timeout: 3000 }
    );
  } catch (error) {
    if (axios.isAxiosError(error) && error.response?.status === 403) {
      core.error(`\u001b[1;31mThis action requires a StepSecurity subscription for private repositories.\u001b[0m`);
      core.error(`\u001b[31mLearn how to enable a subscription: ${docsUrl}\u001b[0m`);
      process.exit(1);
    }
    core.info('Timeout or API not reachable. Continuing to next step.');
  }
}
```

install axios to latest as well
### Docker-Based Action Specific Requirements:

1. **Subscription check code**: If the docker files invokes a script add following code to the script as part of subscription check
```sh
# validate subscription status
UPSTREAM="<original-owner>/<repo-name>"
ACTION_REPO="${GITHUB_ACTION_REPOSITORY:-}"
DOCS_URL="https://docs.stepsecurity.io/actions/stepsecurity-maintained-actions"

echo ""
echo -e "\033[1;36mStepSecurity Maintained Action\033[0m"
echo "Secure drop-in replacement for $UPSTREAM"
if [ "$REPO_PRIVATE" = "false" ]; then
  echo -e "\033[32m✓ Free for public repositories\033[0m"
fi
echo -e "\033[36mLearn more:\033[0m $DOCS_URL"
echo ""

if [ "$REPO_PRIVATE" != "false" ]; then
  SERVER_URL="${GITHUB_SERVER_URL:-https://github.com}"

  if [ "$SERVER_URL" != "https://github.com" ]; then
    BODY=$(printf '{"action":"%s","ghes_server":"%s"}' "$ACTION_REPO" "$SERVER_URL")
  else
    BODY=$(printf '{"action":"%s"}' "$ACTION_REPO")
  fi

  API_URL="https://agent.api.stepsecurity.io/v1/github/$GITHUB_REPOSITORY/actions/maintained-actions-subscription"

  RESPONSE=$(curl --max-time 3 -s -w "%{http_code}" \
    -X POST \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "$BODY" \
    "$API_URL" -o /dev/null) && CURL_EXIT_CODE=0 || CURL_EXIT_CODE=$?

  if [ $CURL_EXIT_CODE -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Timeout or API not reachable. Continuing to next step."
  elif [ "$RESPONSE" = "403" ]; then
    echo -e "::error::\033[1;31mThis action requires a StepSecurity subscription for private repositories.\033[0m"
    echo -e "::error::\033[31mLearn how to enable a subscription: $DOCS_URL\033[0m"
    exit 1
  fi
fi
``` 
Also in this case add a ``REPO_PRIVATE: ${{ github.event.repository.private }}`` env variable in action.yml under runs property. An example is provided for your reference.

```yml
runs:
  using: 'docker'
  image: 'docker://ghcr.io/step-security/mongodb-github-action:v1.12.4@sha256:12db5c5f009fda86ece3f626bd4603b0d9eb70283dc209081eec5681d0a266bf' #v1.12.4
  args:
    - ${{ inputs.mongodb-image }}
    - ${{ inputs.mongodb-version }}
    - ${{ inputs.mongodb-replica-set }}
    - ${{ inputs.mongodb-port }}
    - ${{ inputs.mongodb-db }}
    - ${{ inputs.mongodb-username }}
    - ${{ inputs.mongodb-password }}
    - ${{ inputs.mongodb-container-name }}
  env:
    REPO_PRIVATE: ${{ github.event.repository.private }}
```

if it invokes any other type of file then follow these steps:
- if it is a js or ts file then use code snippets provided in point 9 of [this](#node-based-action-specific-requirements) section.
- if it is any other type of file (ex. .py, .go, .clj) then implement the subscription check in that file using the ts or js version as reference. Try to keep the implementaion almost similar to ts or js version.,

### Composite Action Specific Requirements:

1. **Subscription check code**: Add following snippet as the first step in action.yml file
```yaml
- name: Subscription check
  env:
    REPO_PRIVATE: ${{ github.event.repository.private }}
  run: |
    # validate subscription status
    UPSTREAM="<original-owner>/<repo-name>"
    ACTION_REPO="${GITHUB_ACTION_REPOSITORY:-}"
    DOCS_URL="https://docs.stepsecurity.io/actions/stepsecurity-maintained-actions"

    echo ""
    echo -e "\033[1;36mStepSecurity Maintained Action\033[0m"
    echo "Secure drop-in replacement for $UPSTREAM"
    if [ "$REPO_PRIVATE" = "false" ]; then
      echo -e "\033[32m✓ Free for public repositories\033[0m"
    fi
    echo -e "\033[36mLearn more:\033[0m $DOCS_URL"
    echo ""

    if [ "$REPO_PRIVATE" != "false" ]; then
      SERVER_URL="${GITHUB_SERVER_URL:-https://github.com}"

      if [ "$SERVER_URL" != "https://github.com" ]; then
        BODY=$(printf '{"action":"%s","ghes_server":"%s"}' "$ACTION_REPO" "$SERVER_URL")
      else
        BODY=$(printf '{"action":"%s"}' "$ACTION_REPO")
      fi

      API_URL="https://agent.api.stepsecurity.io/v1/github/$GITHUB_REPOSITORY/actions/maintained-actions-subscription"

      RESPONSE=$(curl --max-time 3 -s -w "%{http_code}" \
        -X POST \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d "$BODY" \
        "$API_URL" -o /dev/null) && CURL_EXIT_CODE=0 || CURL_EXIT_CODE=$?

      if [ $CURL_EXIT_CODE -ne 0 ]; then
        echo "Timeout or API not reachable. Continuing to next step."
      elif [ "$RESPONSE" = "403" ]; then
        echo -e "::error::\033[1;31mThis action requires a StepSecurity subscription for private repositories.\033[0m"
        echo -e "::error::\033[31mLearn how to enable a subscription: $DOCS_URL\033[0m"
        exit 1
      fi
    fi
  shell: bash
```

2. **Action pinning**: If the composite action uses any non-official GitHub actions, ensure that step-security org has an exact substitute of that action and replace that action with its step-security alternative and pin it as well.

---

Format your final output as follows:

<changes>
[Provide detailed, actionable changes organized by category as described above. For each file added or modified, provide the complete content or specific modifications done.]
</changes>

Be thorough and specific in your changes. Provide complete file contents where files were created, and precise modifications where files were updated.


In this action we have multiple actions, all should be validating subscription, also check for upstream author mentions and those kind of things throughly and update them
